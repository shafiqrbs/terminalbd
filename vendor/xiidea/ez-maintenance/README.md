Key Features
------------
* Easy to use

## Installation/Usage

If you're using Composer to manage dependencies, you can include the following
in your composer.json file:

    "require": {
        "xiidea/ez-maintenance": "dev-master"
    }

Then, after running `composer update` or `php composer.phar update`, you can
load the class using Composer's autoloading:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

Otherwise, you can simply require the given `autoload.php` file:

```php
require_once 'PATH_TO_LIBRARY/autoload.php';

```

Then you can just call `EzMaintenance\Worker::watch()` In your `index.php` (see the [example](https://github.com/xiidea/ez-maintenance/blob/master/example/index.php))


## Different Adapters to check maintenance mode

Use adapter to detect if we need to serve the maintenance page or not. 3 Types of adapter provided. You can also define your own adapter.

##### File Adapters

This is the default adapter. it checks for a specific file if exist or not. default path is *down*. For the following implementation
you will be shown maintenance page if there is a file exists named `maintenance.enable`

```php
<?php

EzMaintenance\Worker::watch('file', array(
        'path' => 'maintenance.enable'
));


```

##### Env Adapters

Using this adapter you can watch over existence of an environment variable. The maintenance page will be shown if the environment
 variable is present with specific value.

```php
<?php

EzMaintenance\Worker::watch('env', array(
        'var_name' => 'APPLICATION_ENV',
        'check_value' => 'down'
));


```

##### Const Adapters

This is same ad the env adapter. Only difference is it will check for a php constant instead of environment variable.

```php
<?php

EzMaintenance\Worker::watch('const', array(
        'var_name' => 'APPLICATION_ENV',
        'check_value' => 'down'
));

```

##### Custom Adapters

You can define your own adapter by implementing the `EzMaintenance\Adapter\AdapterInterface`


### Common options

Following options are available to customize the behaviour of the library

##### interval

This option state the interval in second, the system will check for the site status with this interval. default is 5 second.

##### override_key

You can configure a key to override the maintenance mode. This is helpful t test your site normally while others will see maintenance page.
To browse the page in maintenance mode, you just need to pass the override key as query parameter like: `http://yourdomain.com/?key={override_key}`

##### inverse

If you want to enable maintenance mode when adapter return false, you can set `inverse = true`.

##### template

You can provide the built-in template name(simple, game, clock) or path to your own template file. All the options will also be available in your template.
You should `echo $javascript` in your template file to enable auto status check.

```php
<?php
    echo $javascript;
?>
```

##### msg

If you are using any of the default template, you can customize the message using this option.
